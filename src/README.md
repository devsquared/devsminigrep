Basic implementation for a command line grep tool in Rust. 
This started from the [rustbook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) as a way to learn Rust. 

I would like to add to this if I want. I never intend for 
this to be used as a main grep tool without a lot of work.
However, it is a great way to learn cli tooling implementation
in Rust.
